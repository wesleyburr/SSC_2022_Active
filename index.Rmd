## Active Learning

Active learning is an approach to instruction that requires students to 
thoughtfully engage with course material and often with one another in the classroom.

## Some Success

In my large first year introductory course, I like to present real scientific
papers occasionally. One activity that has had some success is presenting
the experimental design behind a study, but **not** the analysis, and then asking students
to place themselves in the shoes of the scientists, and describe the 
hypotheses they might ask, and the analysis required to get some form of
result.

---

## Some Success

This activity ("case study") is only partially completed, as with the 
large class I am not able to have all student groups come up and present
their approach. Also, there would be a lot of repetition. 

<br />

This learning is reinforced with a following large assignment, where 
similar data sets and hypotheses are presented, and students are required
to complete analyses themselves in a literate programming framework.

## Abject Failure

In my 3rd year linear models course, I like to have students attempt
to engage with the algorithms directly through live programming exercises.

<br />

First, we go through the algorithm for solving the linear system. We
discuss computational issues, and various methods for solving matrix
equations involving inverses.

<br />
Then we attempt, in small groups, to write the code required to do the
solving. 

---

## Abject Failure

This ... doesn't work very well. The students really struggle to transition
from the math (that they "understand") to the practice (that they clearly
don't). Computational linear algebra is **hard**. 

<br/>

I think learning happens in the activity, but it isn't what one would call
... entirely successful.

## Caveats

I'm not an expert, or even a journeyman, in active learning techniques. 
The vast majority of my teaching is still lecturing: me, talking or demonstrating,
to students, who sit in a class and follow along.

<br/>
I do try to make the environment engaging, and reflective, but deliberately
designed active learning activities aren't something I've spent a lot of
time, historically, considering. This really should change.
